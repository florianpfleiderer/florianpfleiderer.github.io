This full-stack web application was developed as a semester project for software
development. The frontend is built with React and communicates with a Flask
backend API, while SQLite handles data persistence. The application is
containerized using Docker for easy deployment and development consistency. Key
features include a modern responsive interface built with React components,
RESTful API endpoints for data management, and a containerized development
environment using Docker Compose. The project demonstrates the integration of
modern web technologies and DevOps practices in a practical business
application.
