This project focuses on developing ROS-based software for autonomous robots to
play a hockey-like game. Key objectives include motion control using ROS
navigation stacks, obstacle avoidance via sensor fusion (LIDAR, cameras), and
field component detection (pucks, poles, goals) with computer vision and point
cloud processing. Additional tasks involve field dimension detection,
localization using SLAM techniques, and puck manipulation with robotic
actuators. The robots interact with a referee node and autonomously score goals
in a final competition.
