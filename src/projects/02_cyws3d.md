[`cyws3d-pipeline`](https://github.com/florianpfleiderer/CYWS3D-pipeline) - This project enhances change detection in indoor mobile robots by directly applying the CYWS-3D model to camera data, eliminating the reconstruction step. This approach addresses issues with occluded objects and search area definitions, serving as an indicator for objects missed by existing pipelines, thus improving unsupervised home assistance applications
