This research project advances change detection capabilities in mobile robotics
by implementing a novel approach using the CYWS-3D model. The system processes
raw camera data and point clouds directly, eliminating traditional
reconstruction steps and improving efficiency. Built on ROS and PyTorch, it
implements state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for robust change
detection. By addressing challenges in object occlusion and search area
definition, the pipeline significantly enhances the robot's ability to detect
environmental changes. The implementation integrates seamlessly with existing
robotics frameworks and provides real-time performance, making it particularly
valuable for autonomous home assistance applications. The project demonstrates
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and processing speed compared to
conventional methods, with comprehensive evaluation on standard robotics
datasets.
