[`simplesynth`](https://github.com/florianpfleiderer/SimpleSynth) - The motivation for this project was to develop a simple, modular synthesizer to produce different sounds and create short loops to use in music production. It utilises the ImNodes and ImGui libraries for generation and the Synthesis Toolkit (STK) for creating and processing sounds.
