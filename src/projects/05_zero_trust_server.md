This project implements a Zero Trust security model for server access control,
focusing on the principle of "never trust, always verify." The system uses
strong authentication mechanisms, including certificate-based authentication and
time-based one-time passwords (TOTP), to ensure secure access to server
resources. Key features include mutual TLS authentication, TOTP verification,
and comprehensive logging of all access attempts. The implementation
demonstrates modern security practices and provides a practical example of Zero
Trust architecture in action.
