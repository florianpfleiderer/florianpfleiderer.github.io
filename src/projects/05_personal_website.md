This project is a personal portfolio website built with modern web technologies.
It uses SvelteKit for efficient server-side rendering and client-side
navigation, TailwindCSS for responsive and maintainable styling, and TypeScript
for type safety. The site features a dark mode toggle, dynamic project
galleries, and markdown-based content management. The build process is
automated using GitHub Actions, and the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. The
implementation focuses on performance, accessibility, and maintainability while
providing a clean, professional showcase for projects and writing.
