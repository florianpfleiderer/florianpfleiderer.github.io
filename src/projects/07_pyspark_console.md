This project implements a Python-based console application for analysing large datasets using Apache Spark. Built with PySpark for efficient data processing, it provides an intuitive command-line interface for data analysis tasks. The application features commands for loading CSV files, querying data by column values, applying custom filters, and visualising basic statistics. Key features include automatic data directory scanning, interactive query and filter operations, basic statistical analysis capabilities, and support for exporting results in various formats. The tool is particularly useful for data analysts and researchers working with large datasets who need a lightweight, efficient interface for quick data exploration and analysis without the overhead of a full-featured IDE or notebook environment.
