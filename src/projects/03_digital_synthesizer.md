This project implements a digital modular synthesizer for creating and
manipulating audio signals in real-time. Built with C++ and the JUCE framework,
it leverages ImNodes for an intuitive node-based patching interface and ImGui
for the graphical user interface. The Synthesis Toolkit (STK) provides
professional-grade audio processing capabilities. Key features include multiple
oscillator types (sine, square, saw), customizable signal routing with real-time
visualization, ADSR envelope control, real-time parameter adjustment, and MIDI
input support. The modular design allows users to create complex sound synthesis
chains by connecting different audio processing nodes, making it a versatile
tool for sound design and music production.
