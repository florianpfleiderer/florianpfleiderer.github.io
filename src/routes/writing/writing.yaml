      Model Optimisation and Comparison for Improved Change Detection in
      Autonomous Systems
    date: 2024-07
    summary: >
      This thesis enhances change detection in indoor mobile robots by directly
      applying the CYWS-3D model to camera data, eliminating the reconstruction
      step. This approach addresses issues with occluded objects and search area
      definitions, serving as an indicator for objects missed by existing
      pipelines, thus improving unsupervised home assistance applications.
