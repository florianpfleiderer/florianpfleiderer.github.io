      Model Optimisation and Comparison for Improved Change Detection in
      Autonomous Systems
    date: 2024-07
    summary: >
      This thesis enhances change detection in indoor mobile robots by directly
      applying the CYWS-3D model to camera data, eliminating the reconstruction
      step. This approach addresses issues with occluded objects and search area
      definitions, serving as an indicator for objects missed by existing
      pipelines, thus improving unsupervised home assistance applications.

      Transformer-based World Models in Cloth Manipulation
    date: 2025-08
    summary: >
      This MSc thesis explores the application of Transformer-based state-space
      models (TSSM) for robotic cloth manipulation, specifically the fabric
      flattening task. Building on PlaNet-ClothPick, which uses recurrent models,
      the research investigates whether Transformers can improve prediction and
      planning in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). Results show that
      the Transformer model produces sharper reconstructions, better preserves
      cloth boundaries, improves reward prediction accuracy, and enhances
      planning performance compared to recurrent baselines. This work establishes
      Transformers as a promising tool for deformable object manipulation.
